``Does this create a box around the text?``

 > A block quotation will wrap and flow, and can have *inline*
 ``markup`` just like a regular paragraph.  It will be indented on
 the left (and possibly the right) margins, and may have a vertical
 quotation line on the left.

  >> With two spaces and two right angle brackets, a following block
  quotation will be doubly indented, and will have a second vertical
  quotation line along the left if quotation lines are generated.

   > >> A third level of quotation is the maximum level possible.
